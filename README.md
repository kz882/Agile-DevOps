## Introduction

In this Student Developer Report by HackerRank, the article outlines and aggregates the skills of the current generation of college CS students. The study ranges world wide, more specifically focusing on CS students from United States, Canada, India and the United Kingdom.

## Article Highlights

The first part highlights where students learned coding. The breakdown is as follows:
1. School Only: 31.9%
2. Self Taught Only: 27.4%
3. Both School and Self Taught: 37.7%
4. Neither Self Taught Nor School: 3%

The article states CS curriculum does not teach the nescessary languages or technologies to help students prepare in the work industry. Due to this, more and more students are learning on their own in preperation of the industry.

Furthermore, more students are using youtube as a way to learn the necessary technologies. 

Javascript, along with Node.js and React are more commonly adopted in the web dev industry. Students recognize the demand and place those techonologies/langauges as one of the things to learn. 

## Thoughts

Although the methodology for this research was based on survey, the article was able to provid a basic roadmap of what the next generation of programmers will know. More and more students realize a CS degree is not deterministic in getting a development job. More students are self teaching themselves languages that they haven't been in school. Students are aware of the industry that they wish to get employed in and are preparing for it. While most people try to self teach themselves, the passion for learning is present among students. In the article, it states college students with a CS degree are trying to learn six new languages while most senior developers are comfortable with learning four.

Even though it may not be the primary agenda of the author of the article, it informs me on what I should teach myself first as an aspiring developer. In fact, I will dive deep into JavaScript online tutorials after I finish this assignment, as the survey suggests that more than 40% of employers need it. That said, since Hackerrank is a company that focuses on competitive programming challenges, could some of the fact be misrepresented in the company's interest?

Nice article and comments here! HackerRank is often used by big companies to give Online Assessment for applicants for SDE and the alike. Everytime I see an email popping up with a HackerRank invitation link I panic - I knew I am not gonna make it to even the second round.. The coding challenges are designed in such a way, that except for genius, students must practice on Leetcode outside of class to succeed. This is the inital idea of HackerRank : school and degree and big names don't prove anything, "show me the code". :(
